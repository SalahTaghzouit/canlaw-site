    defaultMessage: 'CanLaw is a legal-tech startup providing a lawyer-discovery platform. Our vision is a world with open access to justice. We are passionate advocates of justice and the rule of law. We believe we can ensure justice for everybody, by innovating legal services through the use of technology. For decades, individuals could only find lawyers either through word-of-mouth or referrals from bankers and property agents. This is due to lawyers having very limited marketing means as strict publicity rules govern the profession. That notion has driven us to be in the business of innovating the legal profession – to help people find the right lawyer at the right price; and to provide lawyers with legal means of being discovered by clients. In doing so, our business is not just about connecting clients with lawyers, but ultimately about improving access to justice. An affiliate company of Brickfields Asia College (BAC), we are alumni of Khazanah’s Project Brainchild pre-accelerator programme and are recipients of Cradle’s CIP Catalyst grant. We are also finalists in the National Blue Ocean Strategy Competition 2016 and winner of the Maxis Inspire Challenge 2016.' },
