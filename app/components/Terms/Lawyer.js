              lawyer discovery platform for users to discover lawyers and/or legal

              <strong>No solicitor-client relationship</strong>
              : Using, corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the
              Platforms and/or Services does not create a solicitor-client
              relationship. You understand that questions and answers or other
              postings to the Platforms and/or Services are not confidential and are
              not subject to solicitor-client privilege. A user may only enter a
              solicitor-client relationship with a participating lawyer of his choice
              when he signs and accepts the participating lawyer&apos;s letter of
              engagement or any such contract, which will take place entirely outside
              of the Platforms. CanLaw will not be a party to any contracts between
              the user and the participating lawyer.
            </Li>

            <Li>
              <strong>No endorsement or recommendation</strong>
              : CanLaw makes no endorsement or recommendation of any particular
              participating lawyer for any specific legal engagement. CanLaw does not
              endorse the content or legality of any responses, statements or
              promises made by the participating lawyers on or off the Platforms. The
              user is solely responsible for assessing the quality, integrity,
              suitability and trustworthiness of the participating lawyer he intends
              to engage and he is ultimately responsible for choosing and entering
              into an engagement with the participating lawyer of his choice.

              legal services or representation. The participating lawyers on the
              Platforms are not employees, agents, representatives or consultants of

              provided by the participating lawyers.

              or split legal fees with the participating lawyers. The user is
              responsible for paying legal fees to the participating lawyer for the
              services provided.

              participating lawyer holds a valid practicing certificate to practice
              law in the jurisdiction he is offering legal services, CanLaw is unable
              to track, or continually monitor/review the standing of each
              participating lawyer that is listed on the Platforms. As such, CanLaw
              makes no representations, guarantees or warranties (express or implied)
              as to the current status, standing, legal ability, competence,
              expertise, professional qualifications or quality of work provided by
              any of the participating lawyers, law firms or legal service providers
              listed on the Platforms. CanLaw shall not be liable for the actions or
              omissions of any participating lawyer acting for a user. The user is
              solely responsible for checking the participating lawyer&apos;s current
              standing with the relevant Bar and evaluating the participating
              lawyer&apos;s expertise, qualification and experience level.

              information submitted by you and stored on the Platforms. However,
              because we cannot control the conduct of others, we cannot guarantee
              that this information will remain confidential or secure. Please
              exercise caution when deciding what information to share or disclose
              when accessing and/or using the Platforms and/or Services. You should
              not let us have any ideas, advertising or marketing suggestions,

              whether such information is confidential, commercially sensitive or
              valuable because we do not monitor the Platforms to check for these
              matters). Therefore, we will not be legally responsible for keeping any
              unwanted submissions confidential nor will we be legally responsible to
              you or anybody else for any use of such unwanted submissions.

              <strong>Rating or review</strong>
              : A rating or review reflects a user&apos;s assessment of a participating
              lawyer, based upon the experience he received from engaging the
              lawyer&apos;s services. A rating or review is not an endorsement or a
              guarantee of the participating lawyer&apos;s quality, competency or ability,
              nor is it a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such
              participating lawyer is involved. Such rating or review is inherently
              subjective in nature, could be inaccurate or incomplete, and is
              difficult or impossible to verify. You release and hold us harmless
              from any and all claims and causes of action arising out of or
              resulting from such rating or review.

              of any remaining provisions.
