      <p>
        This Compliance Statement sets out the compliance considerations that
        CanLaw takes in building and providing the Platform and Services to its
        users and participating lawyers. CanLaw strives to ensure compliance with
        all relevant provisions of the Legal Profession Act 1976 and the rules of
        professional conduct, including the Legal Profession (Practice and
        Etiquette) Rules 1978, the Legal Profession (Publicity) Rules 2001 as well
        as the Bar Council Rulings, both in letter and spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, it is also the responsibility of each participating lawyer who
        uses CanLaw to ensure full compliance with the applicable laws.

                    separate and distinct from all legal fees. This fee remains the same
                    for each participating lawyer, independent of the number of clients
                    that engage them via the Platform and of the fees clients pay. CanLaw
                    does not and will never charge its users for using the Platform and/or
                    Services. Users are responsible for paying legal fees to the

                  <strong>CanLaw’s Services are not solicitations</strong>
                  : Solicitation of a client is known as touting. It is where a lawyer
                  actively seeks the client, not the other way round. On the Platform, it
                  is the client who is seeking the lawyer.

                  <strong>Quotes are not solicitations</strong>

                  explicitly requested for quotes.

                Because it is the client who fills out a form and requests participating

                  Fee quotes are not considered advertising materials. The fee quotes are
                  not binding until they are accepted by the client. Fee quotes are meant
                  to give prospective clients an idea of the total cost and scope of
                  legal services in order for the client to make an informed decision

                  which point the client can book a meeting with the participating lawyer
                  via the Platform. With that, the confidentiality of the client and his
                  legal issues will be preserved, as participating lawyers who are not
                  chosen will not be privy to the client’s identity.

                <Li>
                  If the participating lawyer and client choose to formalise their
                  solicitor-client relationship, it will be done on their own terms.
                  CanLaw does not monitor any engagement letters, documents, contracts or

                We will not be involved in the dealings between participating lawyer and
